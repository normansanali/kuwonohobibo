Few movies enjoy the cult status and enduring popularity of The Wizard of Oz. The 1939 American musical fantasy by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is one of cinema’s greatest masterpieces. However, when it came to creating the film, everything wasn’t rainbows and poppy fields for the Wizard of Oz cast and crew.</p><p id=par-2_48>The story behind the making of The Wizard of Oz is almost as fantastical as the movie. From shocking behind-the-scenes mistreatment of actors to rumored suicides, here is everything you never knew about the making of The Wizard of Oz, including what happened to the famous ruby slippers.</p><h2 id=h-1-the-wizard-of-oz-might-have-been-cursed>1. ‘The Wizard of Oz’ might have been cursed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Wizard-of-Oz-cast-1939.jpg><p id=par-3_13>Was The Wizard of Oz cursed? Hollywood studios seemed to think so.</p><p id=par-4_69>Though the 1939 version of the film is undoubtedly the best known, it wasn’t the first attempt at bringing Frank Baum’s novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, to the screen. A vaudeville-style musical came out in 1902, and a silent movie version debuted in 1910. An adaptation centering on the scarecrow as the main character in 1925 was a box office flop that plunged one Hollywood studio into bankruptcy.</p><h2>2. Wearing the costumes was pure torture for ‘The Wizard of Oz’ cast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_14>The Wizard of Oz cast had to endure utter torture to wear their costumes.</p><p id=par-6_47>For starters, Bert Lahr’s Cowardly Lion costume was made from an actual lion hide and weighed about 90 pounds. It didn’t allow much ventilation, so Lahr was constantly sweating during filming. It got so bad that it took two assistants to dry out the costume every night.</p><p id=par-7_82>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Buddy Ebsen’s Tin Man suit</a> was metal, so he couldn’t even sit down in it. When he got tired, the poor guy had to lean against a board. He also had a violent reaction to his makeup that put him in the hospital. It turns out it was aluminum poisoning due to inhaling the metallic powder applied to his face every day. The incident forced MGM to recast his part to Jack Haley, who played the Tin Man in the movie.</p><h2>3. The movie went through 4 directors</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_14>By the time filming ended, The Wizard of Oz had gone through <a href=#>four directors</a>.</p><p id=par-9_67>Richard Thorpe, the first director, insisted Judy Garland wear a blond wig and thick makeup to depict Dorothy. When Buddy Epsen got sick from his Tin Man makeup and filming shut down for two weeks, the studio fired Thorpe and replaced him with <a href=#>George Cukor of My Fair Lady fame</a>. The new director encouraged Garland to wear natural makeup and play Dorothy less cartoonish and more natural.</p><p id=par-10_42>But later, Cukor left the film to work on Gone With the Wind, and Victor Fleming took his place. However, Cukor returned a few weeks later after Gone With the Wind star Clark Gable got the director fired (reportedly for being homosexual).</p><p id=par-11_26>Yet another director, King Vidor, was responsible for most of the sepia sequences in The Wizard of Oz and helped Mervyn LeRoy with editing in postproduction.</p><h2>4. Judy Garland got slapped in the face</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/tcm/status/1004875656776200193</p></figure><p id=par-12_27>While filming the famous slap scene between Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion, Garland couldn’t stop giggling, according to Michael Sragow’s book Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_26>After several ruined takes, director Viktor Fleming took the <a href=#>teenage Garland</a> aside, slapped her across the face, and told her to “go in there and work.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_13>The next time she attempted the scene, she performed it flawlessly (without giggling).</p><h2>5. Garland might have been molested by Munchkins</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_10>Did Munchkins molest Judy Garland? Her ex-husband claims she was.</p><p id=par-16_34>Sid Luft was married to Garland from 1952 to 1965. According to his memoir, Judy and I: My Life With Judy Garland, the <a href=#>actors who played the Munchkins</a> touched her inappropriately without her consent.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_25>“They would make Judy’s life miserable on set by putting their hands under her dress,” he wrote. “The men were 40 or more years old.”</p><h2>6. Audiences thought the Wicked Witch of the West actor was really evil</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p></figure><p id=par-18_29>Not only did viewers think former kindergarten teacher Margaret Hamilton was evil following the first airing of The Wizard of Oz, but she also suffered physically for the role.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-19_25><a href=#>Hamilton received second- and third-degree burns</a> all over her body when the green copper makeup she was wearing got too hot during the fire scene.</p><p id=par-20_29>In addition, her stunt double spent months in the hospital after a prop broom exploded. Producers used a double because Hamilton had sustained an injury during an earlier take.</p><h2>7.

However, the high cost of production, including technical demands, cast changes, director shifts, and wrecked Technicolor film, made the movie barely break even.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-27_21>It was also pulled from theaters faster than competing titles like <a href=#>Gone With the Wind</a>, which continued showing for several years.</p><h2>10.

Disney’s ‘Snow White’ inspired ‘The Wizard of Oz’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-22><p></p></figure><p id=par-58_33>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered in 1937 with smashing success. That’s one of the main reasons MGM exec Louis B. Mayer was sure The Wizard of Oz would have similar results.</p><p id=par-59_51>The film took many <a href=#>cues from the Disney movie</a>. First, the original Wicked Witch was supposed to be played similarly to the evil stepmother from Snow White. Actor Gail Sondergaard read for the part intending to portray a sexy, beautiful villain, which is why the studio ultimately went in another direction.</p><p id=par-60_43>Still, the lasting impact of Snow White‘s influence can be heard during the Tin Man’s song “If I Only Had a Heart.” When you listen to the line, “Wherefore art thou, Romeo?” you can hear <a href=#>Adriana Caselotti — the voice of Snow White</a>.</p><h2>24. The horses in ‘The Wizard of Oz’ got their color from Jell-O</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-23></figure><p id=par-61_22>Remember the color-changing horses during the “Horse-of-a-Different-Color” scenes?

And a swarm of bumblebees dies while trying to sting Dorothy and the others.</p><h2>26. Bert Lahr performed vaudeville before joining ‘The Wizard of Oz’ cast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-25></figure><p id=par-64_19>It makes sense why the Lion has two musical numbers.

And Ray Bolger gave the eulogy at Margaret Hamilton’s funeral.</p><h2>28. The four stars almost danced the jitterbug</h2><p id=par-68_19>Deleted scenes are nothing new in movies, but this one could have made The Wizard of Oz much different.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-69_27>A flying insect called “The Jitterbug” was supposed to attack Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion. The bug would then make the four dance and sing.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-70_14>However, producers cut the scene to prevent the film from becoming dated too quickly.</p><h2>29.

Judy Garland’s ‘The Wizard of Oz’ diet included black coffee and cigarettes</h2><p id=par-75_53>In addition to wearing a corset, <a href=#>Garland followed a horrible diet</a> to keep her childlike figure while filming The Wizard of Oz. MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer banned her from consuming much beyond black coffee, chicken soup, and <a href=#>cottage cheese</a>. She also smoked up to 80 cigarettes daily to suppress her appetite.&nbsp;</p><h2>32.
