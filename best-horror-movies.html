When the priest responsible then stands trial for her death, we see her chilling tale unfold in flashbacks of what happened both before and during the exorcism. What's more, this story is disturbingly similar to the real exorcism that inspired it...</span><span class=credit>Screen Gems</span><h2 class=title>The Exorcism Of Anneliese Michel</h2><span class=caption-body><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anneliese Michel</a> of Germany began experiencing convulsions when she was 16 years old. While she was diagnosed with epilepsy a year later, Michel then claimed demons were visiting and torturing her. She also began to eat spiders, lick her own urine off the floor, and crawl under a table and bark like a dog repeatedly. After her parents tried to cure her with an exorcism, she died of malnutrition at just 68 pounds in 1976. Eventually, two priests involved in the case were found guilty of negligent homicide.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span><h2 class=title>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)</h2><span class=caption-body>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> routinely ranks with the most famous horror movies of all time, few may know that it was inspired by true events. In fact, this classic horror film about a chainsaw-wielding madman named Leatherface took several cues from the tale of real-life killer Ed Gein.</span><span class=credit>Vortex</span><h2 class=title>Ed Gein</h2><span class=caption-body>Known as "The Butcher of Plainfield," <a href=# rel=noopener>Ed Gein</a> has captivated authors and screenwriters perhaps more than any other American serial killer. Traumatized by an unhealthy relationship with his mother and the isolation of rural Plainfield, Wisconsin, Gein began to kill and dismember locals — and fashion everything from lampshades and gloves to masks and kitchen utensils from their skins. When police searched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gein's house</a> in 1957, they found scores of such grisly items, not to mention a skin suit he was fashioning for himself. He was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in an institution and died there at 77 in 1984.</span><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Candyman (1992)</h2><span class=caption-body><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candyman</a>, one of the scariest horror movies of the modern era, tells the story of a Chicago woman who hears tales of the murderous ghost of a former slave who was killed for his relationship with a white woman. But things turn deadly when she finds that the stories are true and that the Candyman is actually stalking the city's housing projects and entering people's rooms by traveling through mirrors before killing his victims with a hook. While this may sound outrageous, there is a true story of murder in the Chicago projects that helped inspire the film.</span><span class=credit>TriStar</span><h2 class=title>The Ruthie Mae McCoy Murder</h2><span class=caption-body>Though there's no undead, hook-handed killer involved in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real-life story of Candyman</a>, the tragic murder of Ruthie Mae McCoy was just as unsettling. A mentally ill resident of Chicago's South Side ABLA homes, she was killed on April 22, 1987 after fruitlessly calling 911 and begging to be saved from intruders coming in through her bathroom mirror. Authorities finally entered the home two days later and found her dead, face-down on the floor in a puddle of blood — and a hole in her bathroom mirror.</span><span class=credit>David Wilson</span><h2 class=title>The Shining (1980)</h2><span class=caption-body>One of the most enduring classic horror movies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shining</a> remains terrifying four decades after its release. Isolated in a haunted Colorado hotel constructed over an Indian burial ground, the Torrance family has to battle their own demons — and the hotel's — as a massive snowstorm traps them inside. Eventually, patriarch Jack Torrance succumbs to the hotel's powers and goes insane before trying to kill his wife and son.</span><span class=credit>Warner Bros.</span><h2 class=title>The Stanley Hotel</h2><span class=caption-body>While the story of the Torrance family was invented by horror author Stephen King, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real-life Colorado hotel called the Stanley actually did inspire The Shining</a>. King was compelled to write the novel that preceded the film after a chilling stay at the cavernous Stanley as its sole guest one night in 1974. But long before that, the Stanley played host to a series of scary incidents, namely the mysterious 1911 (some sources say 1917) explosion that nearly killed a chambermaid in Room 217 — the very room where King would stay decades later. To this day, guests insist that Room 217 is haunted by the chambermaid's ghost.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><h2 class=title>The Exorcist (1973)</h2><span class=caption-body>There had been very few horror films as disturbing as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Exorcist</a> before its wildly successful 1973 release. Centered on a young suburban girl possessed by a demon, it remains one of the scariest horror movies of all time due to its grotesque imagery and intense exorcism scenes.</span><span class=credit>Warner Bros.</span><h2 class=title>The Roland Doe Exorcism</h2><span class=caption-body>As in The Exorcist, the case of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roland Doe</a> involved an adolescent child subjected to exorcisms due to supposed demonic possession in the picturesque suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. In the 1940s, the 13-year-old Doe began to experience paranormal occurrences like his mattress moving on its own and unexplainable scratching sounds coming from his walls.

DeFeo later claimed that otherworldly voices coming from the house had instructed him to kill. And this wouldn't be the last time that residents of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">112 Ocean Avenue</a> reported paranormal experiences.

As chilling as the onscreen story was, the movie remains infamous for its behind-the-scenes incidents as well. Within six years of the movie being filmed, the two young actresses who portrayed the sisters died tragically. Dominique Dunne was murdered by her boyfriend, while Heather O'Rourke — whose famous line, "They're here," announced the coming of the ghosts — died of congenital intestinal issues at just 12 years old. Some remain convinced a curse was to blame.</span><span class=credit>MGM</span><h2 class=title>The Hermann Family</h2><span class=caption-body>Though it may seem outlandish, Poltergeist was actually inspired by an alleged haunting suffered by the Hermann family of Seaford, Long Island in 1958. "All of a sudden, you'd hear this loud noise, like a popping bottle sound, and you'd look around and find a bottle that was 12 feet away from where it was supposed to be and all the contents were missing and the bottle was hot to the touch," recalled Lucille Hermann.

But Theron's chilling portrayal of Wuornos earned her not only an Academy Award, but the respect of those who knew this killer for real. As Theron recalled, "Al, the bartender who knew Aileen really well—who kind of laughed at us when we showed up for research and said that I was going to play Aileen—went to Patty [Jenkins, the director] and said, 'This is really freaking us out, how much she looks like Aileen and how much she’s carrying herself like Aileen.

But the best horror movies of all time provide several things at once: thrilling entertainment, great fear followed by utter relief, and catharsis for our own deep-seated anxieties and terrors.</p><p>All of these things are perhaps most intense in the classic horror films that are based on actual events. From tales of serial killers to exorcisms to alleged hauntings, the scariest horror movies ever made are often all the more terrifying when we know that we're seeing real-life stories unfolding on the screen.</p><p>Whether it's established favorites like Psycho and The Shining or recent classics like The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Conjuring, these 25 films take on new levels of terror once you've learned the true stories that inspired them.</p><h2>The True Story That Made Scream One Of The Best Horror Movies Of All Time</h2><p>While most fright fans surely know that The Amityville Horror was based on a true story or that The Conjuring's Ed and Lorraine Warren were real-life paranormal investigators, many actual stories behind history's most famous horror movies have stayed under the radar. There's perhaps no better example of this than the Gainesville Ripper and Scream.</p><p>Over the span of just four days in August 1990, Danny Rolling murdered five students in northern Florida and secured his place in true crime history as "The Gainesville Ripper." But it was one particular aspect of the case that allowed Rolling's story to soon secure a place in the history of horror films as well.</p>The unseen killer discusses scary movies with his soon-to-be victim in the opening sequence of Scream.<p>Rolling loved scary movies, namely The Exorcist III, which he admitted to watching obsessively before carrying out his murders. He believed that the film's story of the twisted Gemini serial killer was speaking to him personally.</p><p>"Gemini is a part of Mr. Rolling's persona," said psychiatrist Dr. Robert Sadoff, who testified during Rolling's 1994 trial.</p><p>It was this detail that helped prompt Scream writer Kevin Williamson to pen his draft about a serial killer driven to murder by a deep love and knowledge of the horror genre.</p><p>But while Rolling's story may have been responsible for Scream, his case was even more terrifying than anything the film could ever depict. For example, after he raped and killed 18-year-old University of Florida student Christina Hoyt on August 25, he cut off her head and placed it on her shelf facing her decapitated corpse in hopes of shocking whoever found the body.</p><p>Sometimes, even the scariest horror movies can't fully portray the true-life terrors they're attempting to depict.</p><h2>The Surprising Story Behind A Nightmare On Elm Street</h2><p>While A Nightmare on Elm Street's tale of the infamous Freddy Krueger killing teens in their dreams may sound outlandish, it was actually based on a true story that's nothing like you'd ever expect. In 2008, director Wes Craven <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that his 1984 classic was inspired by the inexplicable deaths of a string of Asian refugees in their sleep.</p><p>"It was a series of articles in the LA Times, about men from South East Asia, who were from immigrant families and who had died in the middle of nightmares — and the paper never correlated them, never said, 'Hey, we've had another story like this.'"</p><p>"The third one was the son of a physician. He was about 21... Everybody in his family said almost exactly these lines: 'You must sleep.' He said, 'No, you don't understand. I've had nightmares before — this is different.'"</p><p>Soon after the young men went to sleep, his parents heard screams coming from his room. They rushed in but were too late.
