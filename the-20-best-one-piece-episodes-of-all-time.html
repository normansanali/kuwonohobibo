It has been immensely popular throughout Asia for decades, further extending to the West steadily through the years, for good reason — this story is known for its incredible worldbuilding, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the bizarre yet coherent power scales</a>, and most of all Eiichiro Oda’s fantastic and nuanced writing.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Using the conventional Shounen formula and tropes, One Piece takes pride in its unique essence, rich storytelling, and above all, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its outstanding and unmatched unpredictability</a>. Whenever the readers, or viewers of the anime, expect something to happen, Oda will most certainly bring in elements that will move and surprise even the oldest One Piece fans, oftentimes bringing them to tears laughing or crying.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Over time, it’s become almost impossible to choose the best episodes among peak fiction, but we tried to take on that (nearly) impossible task, so here are the best episodes of One Piece.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><br>Episode 706 – “Advance, Law! The Kindhearted Man’s Final Fight!”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Corazon-Law-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Dressrosa was one of the most strenuous arcs to watch in One Piece, let’s be honest. It had an amazing story but suffered from terrible pacing. Despite the unfortunate timing, Dressrosa still includes some heartbreakingly beautiful episodes, namely episode 706. Capable of bringing a grown man to tears, this episode depicts Corazón’s ultimate sacrifice to save Law and ensure his safety. It <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">concludes a character arc in the most heartbreaking way possible</a>, as he is killed by his own brother. Nevertheless, it perfectly embodies what One Piece is all about — sacrifice, loyalty, and friendship.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 767 – “A Volatile Situation! The Dog and the Cat and the Samurai!”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/One-Piece-Minks.jpg><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=913 data-injectable=true>While I could go on a rampage to talk about how each individual character — secondary or otherwise — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is absolutely indispensable to the story</a>, the best way to demonstrate it is by watching episode 767. At this point in the story, we’re entering Zou, an island inhabited by Minks — anthropomorphic animals. Initially, we don’t necessarily realize the reasoning for the continuous feud between the Dog and the Cat, but ultimately, we realize that they still fight alongside each other for one very specific reason: To keep Raizo safe and sound as they await a savior to save Wano. Absolute chills.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 86 – “Hiriluk’s Cherry Blossoms and the Will That Gets Carried On!”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-piece-hiruluk.jpg><p data-characters=656 data-current-count=956 data-injectable=true>I realize now that many entries on this list are downright world-shattering — I can’t help it; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece has lots of sad moments</a>. For this reason, of course, we couldn’t skip over episode 86 — Dr. Hiriluk’s death. There are many reasons why this is one of One Piece‘s best episodes; however, we have to stress that Dr. Hiriluk’s death plays a significant role in making this particular episode absolutely perfect. After all, lives were changed with the quote: “When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No… It’s when they are forgotten!” That is all.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 192 – “Miracle On Skypiea! The Love Song Heard in the Clouds!”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>There were a few battles that stuck with us pre-time skip, but Enel’s just hits differently. Despite this episode being from Skypiea — arguably one of One Piece‘s most dragged-out arcs — episode 192 marks a shift for the Straw Hats. Not only do they defeat their biggest opponent to date, but we also witness Luffy’s genius in battle as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he uses his own body as the natural conductor for Enel’s electricity</a>. It’s a fantastic battle and a perfect episode.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 1017 – “Barrage of Powerful Techniques! The Fierce Attacks of the Worst Generation!”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Wano-One-Piece-Worst-Generation.jpg><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>From the moment Wano started, a reunion of the Worst Generation’s strongest pirates was imminent. Finally, in episode 1017, it delivered – and oh boy, did it deliver. In this episode, the fight between the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two (former) Emperors of the Sea Kaido and Big Mom unfolds</a>, against Luffy, Kid, Law, and Zoro. In this moment, we see brilliant animation of their fight and the moments that became infamously known as “Roofpiece.”</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The audience also sees the Worst Generation in action since their first meeting in Sabaody, now much stronger and more powerful than they previously were. Zoro is capable of even injuring Kaido using Enma, one of the only two swords known to have injured the seemingly impenetrable emperor.

At the same time, they create some of the most anxiety and tension-inducing times in the show, which completely enthrall everyone watching and wishing to see how it all unfolds. Episode 236 is the first moment we see one of the Straw Hats actually opposing Luffy — his captain — succumbing to his own insecurities.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>This episode is steeped in tension and uncertainty, and it’s one of those moments that can bring any fan to tears. Usopp’s vulnerability and fear are juxtaposed with the portrayal of two best friends diametrically opposed, illuminated under an ominous blue light. Luffy’s unwavering determination not to lose — coupled with his grief over the potential loss of his best friend — created some of the best fights in One Piece. Truly good stuff.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 1062: “The Three-Sword Style of the Supreme King!

Upon their last encounter in Mock Town, Bellamy challenges Luffy once again, doubting his ability to throw a punch. Much to everyone’s satisfaction, Luffy finally lands a defeating punch on Bellamy, knocking him down right away. Not long after, the audience reunites with a somewhat familiar figure who was once introduced as an incentive for the Straw Hats to never give up their dreams. This character appears for the first time as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening and infamous Blackbeard</a>.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>In general, this episode is one of the first instances where we see the magnificent world built in One Piece.

This act of unwavering loyalty from her captain brings Robin to her breaking point. Overwhelmed by emotions, she breaks down in tears, even as those around her watch intently. In a moment that pierces the heart, Robin cries out one of the most heart-rending quotes in One Piece: “I want to live!”</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Episode 312 – “Thank You, Merry!

With the assistance of Kuma and the paw-paw fruit, Zoro requests to bear his captain’s suffering and enter Luffy’s “bubble of pain.” When discovered lying in a pool of his own blood by Sanji and questioned about the ordeal, Zoro, in his characteristically unwavering loyalty, simply responds, “Nothing happened.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Episode 380 – “Binks’ Sake – The Song that Connects the Past and Present”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=953 data-injectable=true>During the Thriller Bark arc, the figure who would become the musician of the Straw Hats, Brook, is introduced.
