In our new series How to Make a Movie, some of film’s most accomplished artists from a wide array of fields will be explaining their techniques. <i>The Heat</i>’s Paul Feig will teach you how to whittle down hours of improvised hilarity into one movie. <i>Gravity </i>director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki will give a master class on cinematography through five of his most dazzling shots. Diablo Cody will reveal the five things nobody tells you about being a top screenwriter. Superhero-costume designers, prolific film composers, savvy producers: All week long, they’ll be giving imperative advice on how they do what they do. The series kicks off today with an in-depth interview with Wes Anderson on the making of one of his most beloved films, <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-4-0-0@published data-word-count=115>On Tuesday, <i>New York </i>Magazine TV critic Matt Zoller Seitz will release his sumptuous coffee-table book, <i><a href=#>The Wes Anderson Collection</a></i>. The book delves deeply into each of Anderson’s seven films, dissecting every angle and influence with commentary, illustrations, and photography. Every chapter is anchored by a lengthy conversation between Anderson and Seitz about the making of each film: The <i>Tenenbaums</i> chapter, excerpted here, covers everything from finding the perfect Tenenbaum brownstone to Anderson’s trademark shots to recruiting a reluctant Gene Hackman for the role of reappeared patriarch Royal. Follow Anderson’s lessons to find out how to make a masterpiece of humor and melancholy. (And see a gallery of behind-the-scenes pictures <a href=#>from the Tenenbaums shoot here</a>.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-5-0-0@published data-word-count=206><b>Let’s talk about the spaces in The Royal Tenenbaums. Let’s talk about the house. Where is the house? Are the exterior and the interior the same house, or did you shoot those at different places?<br></b>No, it was a real house. At the time I was very adamant that this would be a real place and that we have to make it a real place. The movie’s scheduled around the actors — it’s a little jigsaw puzzle. We have Ben for these three weeks, and we have Gwyneth for only these ten days, and everything is built around that. I felt like they had to have this real place that exists that they can walk into and say, “This is my room. Here’s my room.” And they did. It was also quite practical, I think. The roof was the real roof. It was all one place. The only cheat was with their kitchen, which was in the house next door, because this place had no windows—it was not going to work. But the rest of it’s all there — it’s near Convent Avenue and 144th Street in Harlem, just north of City College. The hotel where Gene Hackman is living at the beginning is the Waldorf.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-6-0-0@published data-word-count=156><b>Were there any places in the movie that were wholly invented, where you built a set? Did you build any sets?<br></b>Well, let’s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no. You know, we built the archaeological site, but they’ve had plenty of those in the city. Everything’s kind of inspired by something, and everything’s done in some converted place. For the 375th Street Y, the exterior was in one place on the Upper East Side, and for the interior we found a place in New Jersey. I can’t remember where. I can’t remember what it’s called, but somewhere in Newark there was this big abandoned hospital, and we made our hospital in it.

There’s a place up there.” And I walked up there, and what I probably saw was a house that looked just like the one in Ambersons, and I thought, “That’s the place.” And I also saw a sign in the window that said it had just been foreclosed on, so I thought, “Well, what state is this going to be in?” What happened was that a guy had just bought it after it was foreclosed on for the amount that we ended up paying him to use it.

Although there was an undercurrent of melancholy to some performances he’d given before, I was completely unprepared for the sheer magnitude of suffering and pain he brought to the part of Richie Tenenbaum.

That’s The Royal Tenenbaums to me — that shot. What was it that made you think he would work in this?<br></b>I just thought he would. That part was written for Luke, certainly, and there were several things at play. One is that Luke has always had some people who were his followers. When Luke got sent to boarding school, he was saying that no one there liked him, and his father went to visit him, and maybe I won’t remember this exactly right, but the thrust of it is that when his father got there, Luke was just being elected one of the prefects or something. When Mr. Wilson got there, what he saw was that Luke was one of the most popular kids in the school, that he was kind of a hero in the school — but Luke just didn’t feel that appreciation I guess. He didn’t want to be there. He was sad there, and he was homesick, and he didn’t want to be there. And that kind of combination, that’s very unusual.

I mean, that was the beginning of the movie, those two things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/152/01b/6edad228e17b303c462ffb67fb6e5903e7-royal-tenenbaums-4.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-105-0-0@published data-word-count=149><b>You’ve got a lot of shots in all your movies where we seem to be physically moving through walls. In some cases they seem to be sets that were specifically built that way, and in other cases you seem to position the camera in such a way that you’re moving through a doorway and it appears that you’re passing through a wall, or you’re going up or you’re going down a level.<br></b>I remember that when we did the opening scene of Bottle Rocket, in the very beginning when he’s in a mental hospital, his bedroom was, in fact, just the end of a long, open room. It wasn’t a little bedroom — we just used three walls of a bigger space. One end of a big room. I remember, at the time, thinking that this is a very good system, which is basically to say, “A set. Interesting.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-106-0-0@published data-word-count=131>And when we did Rushmore, we were supposed to do a scene where they were going to have a ground-breaking for the aquarium, and it was supposed to be on this baseball diamond, and we had all these things organized — and then it rained the night before, and we arrived, and the place was just mud. The field had ceased to be a baseball field. It was a problem. So I sort of came up with, “Let’s not look at the baseball field, then. Let’s look at the dugout and the backstop.” We shot the whole scene in a line, a scene that was meant to be moving all around the place. “We’re going to build a dolly track, and we’re going to go here, here, here, here, and here.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-107-0-0@published data-word-count=47>We did a scene, and I liked how it worked out very much.
